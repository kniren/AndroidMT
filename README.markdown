Android Multi Touch Demo
========================

Simple demostration of touch event handling using [Processing](http://processing.org/) 
and [Eclipse](http://www.Eclipse.org/).

I've found pretty difficult to set up the environment in Linux, so here is your guide:

1. Install Eclipse, the Android SDK and the Android for Eclipse plugins.
2. Download and install the latest release of Processing. I had to use the alpha
   version to make it work.
3. Open one of the examples in Processing and test if you can compile and execute
   it on the emulator and/or your Android device. If not, check another example or 
   download another version of Processing.
4. If everything works, export the project from Processing, a new window should 
   open when it's done.
5. Copy all the files to your desired location.
6. From Eclipse, choose New -> Android project -> Create project from existing
   source.
7. Test to compile the project from Eclipse.
8. Congratulations! You did it!

This project should work just fine doing only the step 7 once you have the
environment set up, if you have any problems, feel free to email me.
